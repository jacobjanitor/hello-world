# hello-world
This is my first repository in GitHub as part of my output from its introductory tutorials.
I am a struggling graduate student of chemistry who has too many interests to distract me from my thesis. These distractions include photography, sports (especially basketball schemes and X's and O's), politics, agriculture and agribusiness, drug discovery through metabolomics, programming and data science, job prospects, accounting, and the outdoors. Too diverse right? That's probably why I'm confused as to what I should really pursue at the moment. Que sera sera!
